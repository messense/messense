### Hi there 👋

Hi 👋, I'm a Python backend developer interested in Rust and try to make Rust and Python work better together.

* 🐍 On Python side I created and maintain [wechatpy](https://github.com/wechatpy/wechatpy).
* 🦀 On Rust side I created and maintain [**jieba-rs**](https://github.com/messense/jieba-rs) and some other crates. 
  * I'm a member of the [**PyO3**](https://github.com/PyO3) organization, focused on developing [**maturin**](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) and 
    its related tooling for example [maturin-action](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-action) and [manylinux-cross](https://github.com/messense/manylinux-cross). 
  * I also work on [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) sometimes.
* 💻 I created and maintain some projects that helps you do cross compilation
    * [homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains](https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains): macOS cross compiler toolchains
    * [rust-musl-cross](https://github.com/messense/rust-musl-cross): Docker images for compiling static Rust binaries using musl-cross
    * [cargo-zigbuild](https://github.com/messense/cargo-zigbuild): Compile Cargo project with zig as linker
    * [cargo-xwin](https://github.com/messense/cargo-xwin): Cross compile Cargo project to Windows MSVC target with ease
